   <p>
     <b>xindy</b> is an index processor that can be used to
     generate book-like indexes for arbitrary document-preparation
     systems. This includes systems such as TeX and LaTeX, the
     roff-family, SGML/XML-based systems (e.g., HTML) that process
     some kind of text and generate indexing information. The
     kernel system is not fixed to any specific system, but can be
     configured to work together with such systems.
   </p><p>
     In comparison to other index processors <b>xindy</b> has several
     powerful features that make it an ideal framework for describing
     and generating complex indices, addressing especially
     international indexing. Have a look at <b>xindy</b>'s
    <a href="features.html"><b>Overview</b></a> that describes
     its most important features!
