    Download &amp; Installation

<text>
  <p>
    There is neither a <b>xindy</b> distribution for Windows nor for
    Mac OS X. We would like to have one, but nobody has done the port
    yet.
  </p><p>
    For Linux, there is the new <em>LaTeX Companion Release</em> that
    has both an easy installation and is easy to use.
  </p><p>
    For other Unix systems, there is a source-based distribution that
    is described below, beneath the horizontal rule.

    The <a

    Area</a> is at SourceForge.
  </p><p>
    Unpack the archive in <tt>/opt</tt> or any other directory. Add
    <tt>/opt/xindy-2.2/bin</tt> to your <tt>$PATH</tt>, and
    <tt>/opt/xindy-2.2/man</tt> to your <tt>$MANPATH</tt>.

  Usage
</leftcol>
<rightcol>
  <p>
    Three user commands have been installed, <tt>texindy</tt>,
    <tt>xindy</tt>, and <tt>makeindex4</tt>.
  </p><p>
    <tt>texindy</tt> and <tt>xindy</tt> are described in the LaTeX
    Companion, 2nd ed. They have man pages as well. <tt>texindy</tt>
    processes LaTeX indices and uses standard modules. <tt>xindy</tt>
    is for those who need or want to write their own <b>xindy</b>
    style files. For them, <a
    href="documentation.html">tutorial and reference documentation</a>
    is available.
  </p><p>
    <tt>makeindex4</tt> comes with an associated man page. It is
    superseded by <tt>texindy</tt>. If you think you need to use it
    because it does something that you cannot realize with
    <tt>texindy</tt> - please address that issue in the mailing list.
    <tt>makeindex4</tt> is good at emulating standard MakeIndex
    behaviour, but has no module or language support. Therefore its
    usage is depreciated.

    <b>Installation on Other Unix systems</b>
  </p><p>
    You will compile <b>xindy</b> kernel source code during
    installation. But you will download and use a binary distribution
    of the compiler to do that.
  </p><p>
    So, let's start...

    Fetch
    <ol>
      <li><tt>xindy-2.1.tar.gz</tt></li>
      <li>
	<tt>xindy-2.1-<i>platform</i>.tar.gz</tt>, where
	<i>platform</i> is appropriate for your system.

  </p><p>
    If you want to use <b>xindy</b> on HP-UX or SunOS 4, you'll have
    to fetch the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10646&amp;release_id=57988">2.0
    release</a>. Current compiler distributions don't exist for these
    platforms.
  </p><p>
    If you want to use <b>xindy</b> on Windows or OS/2, you'll have to
    fetch the <a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10646&amp;release_id=57988">2.0
    release</a>, too. The rest of this installation instructions won't
    work under these operating systems, though. Your best bet is
    getting GNU make (e.g., from <a
    href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a>) and adapting the
    Makefiles. Your help to improve that miserable situation would be
    really welcome.

  Unpack
</leftcol>
<rightcol>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Unpack <tt>xindy-2.1.tar.gz</tt>. The directory <tt>xindy</tt>
      is created.
    </li>
    <li> Change current directory to <tt>xindy</tt>. </li>
    <li> Unpack <tt>xindy-2.1-<i>platform</i>.tar.gz</tt>. </li>
    <li> Unpack <tt>xindy-make-rules-0.2.tar.gz</tt>. </li>

  Create xindy format
</leftcol>
<rightcol>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Create a symlink <tt>current</tt>:
      <pre>  ln -s xindy-2.1 current</pre>
    </li>
    <li> Change current directory to <tt>binaries/<i>platform</i></tt>. </li>
    <li>
      <b>xindy</b> will be installed in <tt>/usr/local</tt>. If you
      don't like this, change it in <tt>Makefile.install</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create the format:
      <pre>
  make all
  make gzipped
</pre>
      During <tt>make all</tt>, there will be warnings about an
      unspecified installation directory. Ignore them.
    </li>
    <li>
      (Optional) Run tests:
      <pre>  make testsuite</pre>
      This will end with the message that tests <em>ex1</em> and
      <em>ex2</em> have failed. That is a known problem with the
      tests, not with <b>xindy</b>.

  Install xindy
</leftcol>
<rightcol>
  <ol>
    <li>
      By default, the <b>xindy</b> command will be installed in
      <tt>/usr/local/bin</tt> and auxiliary files in
      <tt>/usr/local/lib/xindy</tt>. You might have changed these
      directories, as explained above.
      <pre>  make install</pre>
      Most probably, you can only do this as <em>root</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      (Optional) You might want to copy the man pages to appropriate
      directories, e.g.,
    <pre>
  cd /usr/local
  cp lib/xindy/doc/*.1 man/man1
  cd -
</pre>
    </li>
  </ol>
</rightcol>

<coltext>
<leftcol>
  Install language modules
</leftcol>
<rightcol>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Change your current directory to <tt>../../xindy-make-rules-0.2</tt>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you don't have GNU make, get it and install it. (Linux
      users have it by default, the others should know.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If you have changed the installation directory of <b>xindy</b>,
      you need to adapt the settings in <tt>Makefile</tt>.
    </li>
    <li> Install with <pre>  make install</pre> </li>
  </ol>

  Usage
</leftcol>
<rightcol>
  <p>
    Three user commands have been installed, <tt>makeindex4</tt>,
    <tt>makeindex.sh</tt> and <tt>xindy</tt>.
  </p><p>
    <tt>makeindex4</tt> comes with an associated man page,
    <tt>makeindex.sh</tt> has a good usage message, and <a
    href="documentation.html">tutorial and reference documentation</a>
    exist for <tt>xindy</tt>.
  </p><p>
    The best way to learn about <b>xindy</b> usage before the LaTeX
    Companion Release is to copy an example index style, and change
    it. A good one is in <tt>xindy-make-rules-0.2</tt>.
