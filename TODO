[Problem]	XSLT

Somehow, RCS Id tags of the XML file and the XSL files should be
implanted as comments in the HTML file. This way we are able to
reconstruct which version is on the Web page.

[Problem]	Document format

Some documents are in SGML linuxdoc.
reference source is in CVS:xindy/Doc/.
It's using sgml-tools 1.0.9.
Created HTML has no xindy L&F, and no links to rest of Web page.
Created Postscript should be PDF, and should use outline fonts.
linuxdoc has been aborted, we should switch to DocBook.

Some documents are in LaTeX.
Reference source is in CVS:xindy/Reports/
Christine has created PDF with pdflatex, changes are not yet committed.

[Missing]	contributions

The old homepage had a section with contributions. Should we add such
a section as well, with an uncommented archive list?

[Missing]	ISO Documents

fetch them from http://std.dkuug.dk/JTC1/SC22/WG20/
sort rules in documents/
There is also /software/trans/n610.doc (Word Perfect)
Any other documents from that site?

Am I allowed to put them in CVS? On the Web Site?

[Change]	CSS clean up

link colors -- can we specify link colors of navigation bar, headline,
and main area for each area at one place, without having to specify
this for each class anew?

similar for background-color.

[Missing]	Navigation: Different color for current page:

sidelabelselected is actually sidelabelopen.
sidelabelselected itself should be the current page, and should get
yet another color (turqoise?!)

[Change]	Too much tables

How about a markup that uses less tables, and more CSS2?!

Make width of inner table dependent on browser? The rightcol column is
very narrow. E.g., check download-binary.html!
