This is the content of the Web Site http://www.xindy.org/.

You need an XSLT processor to create the HTML pages. We used
Xalan-Java2, from xml.apache.org. The testXSLT command from Xalan-C++
seems to have the same command line interface, so it might be possible
to use it as well -- we haven't that tested, though.

There is a Makefile supplied for your convenience, you'll need GNU
Make to use it.
 -- make  or  make all  will create the Web Site
 -- make dist  will update the Web Site with the new content, if you
    have sufficient access rights on www.xindy.org. Very few people
    have, btw; changes should be committed to the Sourceforge
    sub-project and will be updated in due course.


All files in the doc/ subdirectory are generated. Their reference
versions are found in other CVS modules, refer to doc/README for more
information. All files in the top-level directory are part of the www
CVS module of the xindy project.


The markup used in the XML files is quite simplistic:

 -- sitemap.xml holds a list of all pages of this Web Site and
    associates them with titles and groups. This file is used to
    create the navigation bar at the side.

 -- The category menu in the headline is hardcoded in header.xsl and
    must be changed there.

 -- Other *.xml use the following simplistic markup:

	<page category="GROUP">
	  <sitemap filename="sitemap.xml"/>
	  <title>XHTML TEXT</title>

	  <text>	      <!-- optional -->
	      XHTML TEXT
	  </text>

	  <coltext>           <!-- optional, repeatable -->
	    <leftcol-title>     <!-- optional -->
	      XHTML TEXT
	    </leftcol-title>
	    <leftcol>
	      XHTML TEXT
	    </leftcol>
	    <rightcol>
	      XHTML TEXT
	    </rightcol>
	  </coltext>

	  <next url="URL">TEXT</next>   <!-- optional, repeatable -->
	  <prev url="URL">TEXT</prev>   <!-- optional, repeatable -->

	</page>

    where GROUP must match the <group> entry in sitemap.xml. The
    <title> content is used within the page for a big major headline,
    but not as an HTML title. (The HTML title is fixed, though this
    should change ASAP.)
